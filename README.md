## Lab 06

### Salmon Cookies

In this lab I created objects for each location of Pat's cookie shop. Each object included data and methods that allowed me to display how many cookies were sold for each hour each store was open. I was about to do this using a variety of for loops and DOM interaction in JS.

### Reflections and Comments

Today I learned about how to create and use objects. I also got some practice about nested for loops and when not to nest for loops even though it seems like you should. I also learned how to use JS and the DOM to right html code inside Js. This is useful. It allows you to loop over the html you've written in JS so you don't have to write as much strict html. I had a lot of trouble getting the for loop to iterate over the times I wanted. I'm also wondering if it's not a good idea to use a name other than i in a for loop. The internal forces that motivate me for learning is the excitement that new information give me. Especially if it's practical, pragmatic information.

## Lab 07

### Salmon Cookies 07

In this lab I created a constructor that allowed me to create objects for each shop location. I put all the data into the a table based on time of day, location, and total cookies sold. To do this I used DOM interaction and prototype calls to change and store object data.

### Reflections and Comments 07

Today I learned about constructors and prototypes. Constructors are like templates for objects that allows you to rapidly create objects. The constructor allows you to pass in values so you can add values you want to the properties you need. prototypes are functions that you can call on objects that were created with the specified constructor. .toLowerCase() is an example of a prototype function that JS give you. I can see how creating you own prototypes could be so useful especially when you're dealing with a lot of data. The most unexpected part of  today was learning about prototypes. I had a suspicion that there we were going to learn an easier way to make objects, but prototypes took me by surprise. The fact that keeping the same syntax for object method calls and prototypes was helpful for today.
