## Lab 06

### Salmon Cookies

In this lab I created objects for each location of Pat's cookie shop. Each object included data and methods that allowed me to display how many cookies were sold for each hour each store was open. I was about to do this using a variety of for loops and DOM interaction in JS.

### Reflections and Comments

Today I learned about how to create and use objects. I also got some practice about nested for loops and when not to nest for loops even though it seems like you should. I also learned how to use JS and the DOM to right html code inside Js. This is useful. It allows you to loop over the html you've written in JS so you don't have to write as much strict html. I had a lot of trouble getting the for loop to iterate over the times I wanted. I'm also wondering if it's not a good idea to use a name other than i in a for loop. The internal forces that motivate me for learning is the excitement that new information give me. Especially if it's practical, pragmatic information.

### Salmon Cookies 07

In this lab I created a constructor that allowed me to create objects for each shop location. I put all the data into the a table based on time of day, location, and total cookies sold. To do this I used DOM interaction and prototype calls to change and store object data.

Today I learned about constructors and prototypes. Constructors are like templates for objects that allows you to rapidly create objects. The constructor allows you to pass in values so you can add values you want to the properties you need. prototypes are functions that you can call on objects that were created with the specified constructor. .toLowerCase() is an example of a prototype function that JS give you. I can see how creating you own prototypes could be so useful especially when you're dealing with a lot of data. The most unexpected part of  today was learning about prototypes. I had a suspicion that there we were going to learn an easier way to make objects, but prototypes took me by surprise. The fact that keeping the same syntax for object method calls and prototypes was helpful for today.

In this lab I styled and added content to the index html page. This will be the front facing page. I added the content that was required and did as much styling as I could manage. I used the flex display when I could. I created a seperate stylesheet for my index html file to keep organized.

Today I learned about the flex display in css. I thought it was much easier to style using the flex property. I also learned it is best to style from left to right and top to bottom which was also very helpful in styling my web page. I also learned about wire-framing and how useful they are. It's much easier to style with css when you already know what you are trying to do. I often find myself using css in a throw it at the wall and see what sticks fashion. Using wire-frames makes it much clearer what needs to be done for the web site to look good. I also learned how to use the pseudo class :hover with the transition attribute to make a hover transition look really good.

### Reflections and Comments 09

Today I learned how to write and use a form using html and JS. In html you use the form with child elements like feildset, label, and input. For label and input, the for and for attribute on the label tag and the id attribute on the input tag must match so they can be tethered together. In JS you have to create a DOM window with the form, an event listener and a call back function. It can be confusing how the event listeners are asynchronous. They only call the call back function when the event occurs which means it isn't included in the top to bottom running of the code. Instead you have to think of it in terms of time. Not which code if first on the page, but which code runs and is complete first in time. I think the learning retention pyramid is close to correct for me. I would flip reading and lecture though. I don't find the readings very useful. I do however find the books useful when I need them.
