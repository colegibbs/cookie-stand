## Lab 06

### Salmon Cookies

In this lab I created objects for each location of Pat's cookie shop. Each object included data and methods that allowed me to display how many cookies were sold for each hour each store was open. I was about to do this using a variety of for loops and DOM interaction in JS.

### Reflections and Comments

Today I learned about how to create and use objects. I also got some practice about nested for loops and when not to nest for loops even though it seems like you should. I also learned how to use JS and the DOM to right html code inside Js. This is useful. It allows you to loop over the html you've written in JS so you don't have to write as much strict html. I had a lot of trouble getting the for loop to iterate over the times I wanted. I'm also wondering if it's not a good idea to use a name other than i in a for loop. The internal forces that motivate me for learning is the excitement that new information give me. Especially if it's practical, pragmatic information.
